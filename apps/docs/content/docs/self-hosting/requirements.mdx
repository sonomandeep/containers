# Requirements

Before you deploy Containers, make sure you have:

## Infrastructure

- A Linux host with **Docker Engine** and **Docker Compose** installed.
- Access to the Docker socket (`/var/run/docker.sock`).
- At least 2 GB of RAM for a small install.

## Services

- **PostgreSQL** database
- **SMTP** credentials for email verification

## Networking

- A domain or subdomains for the web app and API
  (e.g. `app.example.com` and `api.example.com`)
- Ability to open HTTP ports (80) on the host

If you use Traefik (recommended in the Docker Compose setup), you also need an
external Docker network called `proxy`.
