# Storage

Docker Compose defines two persistent volumes:

- `postgres_data` for PostgreSQL
- `api_uploads` for uploaded files

## Uploads

Uploads are stored at the path defined by `UPLOAD_DIR` in the API container
(default `/data/uploads`). This is backed by the `api_uploads` volume.

## Backups

To back up your data, snapshot both volumes:

- PostgreSQL data (`postgres_data`)
- Uploads (`api_uploads`)

If you restore from backups, restart the stack after replacing the volumes.
