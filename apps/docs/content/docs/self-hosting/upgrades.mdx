# Upgrades

When a new version is available, rebuild and restart the stack.

## Upgrade steps

```sh
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --build
```

## Database migrations

If a release requires database migrations, follow the instructions in the
release notes before starting the new version.

## Rollbacks

If an upgrade fails, return to the previous version by rebuilding with the
older code and restarting the stack.
