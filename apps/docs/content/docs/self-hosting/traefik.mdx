# Traefik Routing

The Docker Compose setup uses Traefik to route traffic.

## Host-based routing

Two routers are defined via labels:

- `api.example.com` → API service (port 9999)
- `app.example.com` → Web app (port 3000)

Update these hostnames in `docker-compose.yaml` to match your own domains.

## Networks

Both `api` and `web` services attach to the external `proxy` network so Traefik
can reach them. Make sure the network exists:

```sh
docker network create proxy
```

## HTTPS/TLS

TLS is not configured in the default compose file. For production, add HTTPS
configuration (e.g. Let’s Encrypt) to Traefik.
