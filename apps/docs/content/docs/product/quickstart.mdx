# Product Quickstart

This guide walks you through the core workflow inside Containers.

## 1) Sign in

Create an account and verify your email. After login, you land on the
Containers page.

## 2) Understand the Containers view

Each card shows:

- Name and image
- Status and state (running, paused, exited, restarting)
- CPU and memory usage (for running containers)
- Exposed ports and host

Use the action buttons to start, stop, or restart a container.

## 3) Launch a container

Click **Launch Container** and follow the 3-step wizard:

- **Basic:** name, image, command, restart policy
- **Config:** CPU, memory, network, environment variables, ports
- **Summary:** review and confirm

Validation prevents common mistakes (invalid names, duplicate ports, invalid
environment variable keys).

## 4) Use the terminal

From a running container, open the menu and choose **Terminal**. A remote shell
opens in your browser. Closing the dialog closes the session.

## 5) Manage images

Open **Images** to view all images, see which containers use them, and pull new
images from a registry. Remove images you no longer need.

> **Work in progress:** Logs, volumes, and environment variable updates are not
> fully implemented yet. Some UI items may appear but have no effect.

## Tips

- If a container is running, delete is disabled. Stop it first.
- If the terminal does not connect, ensure the container is running and the API
  is reachable.
