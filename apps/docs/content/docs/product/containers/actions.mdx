# Container Actions

Each container exposes quick actions in the card header and additional options
in the menu.

## Start

Available for containers that are paused or exited. Starting a container updates
its status and metrics.

## Stop

Available for running containers. Stopping a container will clear live metrics.

## Restart

Available for running containers. Restart keeps the same configuration but
restarts the process.

## Delete

Available only for **exited** containers. You must stop a running container
before it can be deleted.

Deleting a container is permanent and requires confirmation.
