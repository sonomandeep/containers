# Containers Overview

The Containers page is your main dashboard. It lists every container on the
host and shows real-time status and metrics.

## Container cards

Each container card includes:

- **Name** and **image** used to run the container.
- **State** (running, paused, exited, restarting, created).
- **Status** string from Docker (e.g. uptime).
- **Ports** exposed on the host.
- **CPU and memory** usage for running containers.

## States and status

Containers uses the Docker state to drive UI actions:

- **Running:** you can stop or restart.
- **Paused:** you can start.
- **Exited:** you can start or delete.
- **Restarting:** actions are temporarily limited.

## Metrics

CPU and memory metrics show only for running containers. If a container is
stopped, metrics are displayed as `-`.

## Ports

Ports are displayed as host → container mappings. Containers without mappings
show **No Ports**.
