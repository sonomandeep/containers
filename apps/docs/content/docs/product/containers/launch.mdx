# Launch a Container

Click **Launch Container** to open the wizard. You will complete three steps:
Basic, Config, and Summary.

## Step 1: Basic

**Name**  
Unique container name. Letters, numbers, dots, dashes, and underscores are
allowed. Must start with a letter or number.

**Image**  
Select an existing image from your host.

**Command (optional)**  
Override the default command (e.g. `node index.js`).

**Restart Policy**  
Choose how Docker restarts the container:

- **No Policy**
- **Always**
- **On Failure**
- **Unless Stopped**

## Step 2: Config

**CPU (optional)**  
CPU cores, from `0.1` to `128`.

**Memory (optional)**  
Memory in MB (e.g. `512`).

**Network (optional)**  
Join a Docker network by name.

> **Work in progress:** The network selector is currently empty. Leave this
> field blank unless you know the network name and want to type it manually.

**Environment variables (optional)**  
Add key/value pairs. Keys must be unique and use valid variable names.

**Ports (optional)**  
Map host ports to container ports. Public ports must be unique.

## Step 3: Summary

Review the configuration and confirm. Containers will create and start the
container immediately.

## Common validation rules

- Port values must be between `1` and `65535`.
- Public ports cannot be duplicated.
- Environment variable keys must be unique.
- Port mappings are not allowed with the `host` network.
