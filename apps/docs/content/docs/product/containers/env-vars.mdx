# Environment Variables

You can view and edit environment variables for a running container from the
container menu.

> **Work in progress:** Environment variable updates are not applied yet. The
> UI is visible, but the backend endpoint is not implemented.

## What you can do

- Inspect the existing environment variables.
- Prepare updates you plan to apply.

Once the backend support is enabled, changes will trigger a container restart.
