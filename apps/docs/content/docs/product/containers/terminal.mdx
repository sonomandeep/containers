# Remote Terminal

Containers lets you open an interactive shell inside a running container.

## How it works

The terminal opens a WebSocket connection to the API and runs a shell inside the
container. When you close the dialog, the session ends.

## Requirements

- The container must be **running**.
- The API must be reachable from your browser.
- Your network must allow WebSocket connections.

## Troubleshooting

If the terminal does not connect:

- Confirm the container is running.
- Verify the API URL is correct and reachable.
- Check if a reverse proxy or firewall blocks WebSocket traffic.
