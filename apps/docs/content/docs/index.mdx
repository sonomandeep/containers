# Containers

Containers is a self-hosted platform to monitor and manage OCI-compliant
containers through a clean, fast interface. It connects to your Docker host,
shows live container state and metrics, and lets you launch, stop, or remove
containers without leaving the browser.

## What you can do

- Monitor containers and their status at a glance.
- Launch new containers from existing images.
- Start, stop, or restart workloads with one click.
- Inspect images, pull new ones, and remove old ones.
- Open a remote terminal for running containers.

## Who it's for

If you run containers on your own infrastructure and want a simple UI without
handing control to a third party, Containers is built for you.

## How it works

Containers runs as a web app and an API service. The API talks to the Docker
socket, while the web UI presents real-time state and actions. You host it
yourself, so your data stays on your infrastructure.

> **Work in progress:** Logs, volumes, and environment variable updates are
> visible in the UI but not fully implemented yet.
