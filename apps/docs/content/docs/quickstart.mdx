# Quickstart

This quickstart gets Containers running locally with Docker Compose.

## 1) Prepare the host

Make sure Docker Engine and Docker Compose are installed.

## 2) Create the proxy network

```sh
docker network create proxy
```

## 3) Configure environment files

Create:

- `apps/api/.env.prod`
- `apps/web/.env.prod`

At minimum, set:

- `APP_URL` (web app URL)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (API URL)
- `DATABASE_URL`
- SMTP credentials for email verification

## 4) Start the stack

```sh
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=${NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL:-http://api.example.com} \
  docker compose up -d --build
```

## 5) Verify

Open the web app URL and make sure the UI loads.
