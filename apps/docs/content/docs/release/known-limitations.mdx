# Known Limitations

The following items are visible in the UI but not fully implemented yet:

- Container **logs**
- **Volumes** page and volume management
- **Environment variable updates** for containers
- **Forgot password** and **reset password** flows
- Network selection dropdown in the launch wizard

If a feature is important for your workflow, check future release notes for
updates.
