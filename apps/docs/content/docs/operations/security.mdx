# Security

Containers runs with access to the Docker socket, so treat it as a privileged
service.

## HTTPS

Always use HTTPS in production. Configure TLS in your reverse proxy (Traefik,
Nginx, or similar).

## Cookies and origins

Set `APP_URL` to the web app URL so CORS and email callbacks work correctly. If
you use multiple subdomains, enable cross-subdomain cookies:

```
AUTH_CROSS_SUBDOMAIN_COOKIES_ENABLED=true
AUTH_CROSS_SUBDOMAIN_COOKIES_DOMAIN=.example.com
```

## Network access

Restrict access to the app and API to trusted networks where possible.

## Docker socket

The API requires `/var/run/docker.sock`. Anyone who can access the API can
control Docker, so protect the API endpoint carefully.
