# Monitoring

## Health checks

- Web UI: `http://app.example.com`
- API reference: `http://api.example.com/reference`

If the API reference does not load, the API service is not reachable.

## Metrics

Container metrics refresh automatically. If metrics stop updating, check:

- API connectivity
- SSE support in your network/proxy

## Logs

The UI does not currently expose container logs. Use Docker CLI logs on the host:

```sh
docker logs <container_id>
```
