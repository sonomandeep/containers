# Concepts

This page explains the core building blocks you’ll see in Containers.

## Containers

A **container** is a running instance of an image. Containers can be started,
stopped, restarted, and removed. Each container has a state (running, paused,
exited, restarting, created).

## Images

An **image** is a packaged filesystem and runtime configuration. Images are used
to create containers. You can pull new images from registries and remove images
that are no longer needed.

## States and status

Containers uses Docker’s state to drive available actions:

- **Running:** you can stop or restart.
- **Paused:** you can start.
- **Exited:** you can start or delete.
- **Restarting:** actions are temporarily limited.

## Metrics

CPU and memory metrics are shown for running containers only. If a container is
stopped, metrics appear as `-`.

## Terminal

The terminal opens a remote shell inside a running container. It requires the
API to be reachable and WebSocket connections to be allowed by your network.

> **Work in progress:** Logs, volumes, and environment variable updates are not
> fully implemented yet.
