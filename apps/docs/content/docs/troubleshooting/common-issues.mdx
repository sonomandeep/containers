# Common Issues

## I can’t sign in

- Make sure your email is verified.
- Check cross-subdomain cookies if `app.example.com` and `api.example.com` are
  on different subdomains.
- Verify `APP_URL` matches the web app URL.

## The UI loads but data is empty

- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` points to the API.
- Open `http://api.example.com/reference` to confirm the API is reachable.

## Terminal does not connect

- The container must be running.
- Check if your proxy blocks WebSocket traffic.

## Metrics do not update

- Server-Sent Events (SSE) may be blocked by your proxy.
- Confirm the API is reachable from the browser.

## Image removal fails

- Images cannot be removed while used by containers.
- Stop and delete those containers, then retry.

## Verification emails are not sent

- Validate SMTP credentials in `apps/api/.env.prod`.
- Confirm your SMTP provider allows the sender address in `EMAIL_FROM`.
